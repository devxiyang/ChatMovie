The film's artistic merit lies in its stark simplicity—the animation's beauty juxtaposed with the brutal realities of starvation and loss.  Tatsumi and Shiraishi deliver heartbreaking performances as the orphaned siblings, their bond the film's emotional core.  While the wartime setting is crucial, the film transcends its historical context, exploring universal themes of survival, familial love, and the devastating consequences of conflict.  Its enduring cultural impact stems from its unflinching portrayal of childhood trauma, leaving a lasting impression long after the credits roll. A masterpiece of understated power.",
